# Implementing Production-Grade RAG Systems with AWS MemoryDB and LangChain's InMemoryVectorStore: A Complete Guide to Custom Schemas and Advanced Filtering

Building production-ready Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) applications requires a robust vector database that can handle high throughput, maintain low latency, and provide advanced filtering capabilities. AWS MemoryDB combined with LangChain's `InMemoryVectorStore` offers a powerful solution for enterprise-grade RAG systems. This article explores how to implement such systems, focusing on custom schemas and advanced filtering techniques.

## Introduction to AWS MemoryDB and LangChain Integration

AWS MemoryDB is a durable, in-memory database service compatible with Redis that provides ultra-fast performance with high availability and durability. When paired with LangChain's `InMemoryVectorStore`, it becomes an excellent choice for production RAG applications that need to handle large volumes of vector embeddings with sophisticated query capabilities.

The `InMemoryVectorStore` class in LangChain provides a convenient interface for working with AWS MemoryDB as a vector database. It supports various connection methods, custom schemas, and advanced filtering options that make it suitable for production use cases.

## Setting Up the Environment

Before diving into implementation details, let's set up the necessary environment. You'll need to install the Redis Python package to work with AWS MemoryDB:

```python
pip install redis langchain-aws
```

## Connecting to AWS MemoryDB

The `InMemoryVectorStore` supports several connection URL schemas:

```python
from langchain_aws.vectorstores.inmemorydb import InMemoryVectorStore
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings

# Simple connection
redis_url = "redis://host:port"

# Connection with authentication
redis_url = "redis://username:password@host:port"

# Connection with SSL
redis_url = "rediss://host:port"

# Connection with SSL and authentication
redis_url = "rediss://username:password@host:port"

# Initialize the vector store
embedding_model = OpenAIEmbeddings()
vector_store = InMemoryVectorStore(
    redis_url=redis_url,
    index_name="my_production_index",
    embedding=embedding_model
)
```

## Creating and Populating the Vector Store

There are several ways to create and populate an `InMemoryVectorStore`:

### Method 1: Creating from Documents

```python
from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader
from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter

# Load and split documents
loader = TextLoader("path/to/document.txt")
documents = loader.load()
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
docs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)

# Create vector store from documents
vector_store = InMemoryVectorStore.from_documents(
    documents=docs,
    embedding=embedding_model,
    index_name="my_production_index"
)
```

### Method 2: Creating from Texts

```python
texts = [
    "AWS MemoryDB provides Redis compatibility with durability",
    "LangChain offers tools for building LLM applications",
    "Vector databases store embeddings for semantic search"
]

metadatas = [
    {"source": "aws_docs", "category": "database", "year": 2023},
    {"source": "langchain_docs", "category": "framework", "year": 2022},
    {"source": "vector_db_article", "category": "database", "year": 2023}
]

vector_store = InMemoryVectorStore.from_texts(
    texts=texts,
    embedding=embedding_model,
    metadatas=metadatas,
    index_name="my_production_index"
)
```

### Method 3: Creating and Getting Keys

For cases where you need to track the Redis keys of the stored documents:

```python
vector_store, keys = InMemoryVectorStore.from_texts_return_keys(
    texts=texts,
    embedding=embedding_model,
    metadatas=metadatas,
    index_name="my_production_index"
)
print(f"Document keys: {keys}")
```

## Connecting to an Existing Index

For production systems, you often need to connect to an existing index:

```python
vector_store = InMemoryVectorStore.from_existing_index(
    embedding=embedding_model,
    index_name="my_production_index",
    redis_url=redis_url
)
```

## Advanced Configuration: Custom Vector Schema

The default vector schema in `InMemoryVectorStore` uses flat (k-NN) search. For production workloads, you might want to use HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) which offers better performance for approximate nearest neighbor search:

```python
# Define custom vector schema
vector_schema = {
    "algorithm": "HNSW",    # Use HNSW instead of FLAT
    "m": 16,                # Number of connections per node
    "ef_construction": 200, # Size of the dynamic candidate list during construction
    "distance_metric": "COSINE"  # Distance metric: COSINE, IP, or L2
}

# Create vector store with custom vector schema
vector_store = InMemoryVectorStore(
    redis_url=redis_url,
    index_name="production_hnsw_index",
    embedding=embedding_model,
    vector_schema=vector_schema
)
```

## Advanced Configuration: Custom Index Schema

One of the most powerful features of `InMemoryVectorStore` is the ability to customize how metadata is indexed, enabling advanced filtering capabilities:

```python
# Define custom index schema as a dictionary
index_schema = {
    "properties": [
        {
            "name": "category",
            "type": "TAG"
        },
        {
            "name": "year",
            "type": "NUMERIC"
        },
        {
            "name": "source",
            "type": "TEXT"
        }
    ]
}

# Alternatively, define schema as YAML
index_schema_yaml = """
properties:
  - name: category
    type: TAG
  - name: year
    type: NUMERIC
  - name: source
    type: TEXT
"""

# Create vector store with custom index schema
vector_store = InMemoryVectorStore(
    redis_url=redis_url,
    index_name="production_filtered_index",
    embedding=embedding_model,
    index_schema=index_schema  # or index_schema_yaml
)
```

By default, `InMemoryVectorStore` automatically generates an index schema with the following rules:
- Strings are indexed as text fields
- Numbers are indexed as numeric fields
- All other types are not indexed

You can override these defaults with a custom schema, which is particularly useful for optimizing filter performance.

### Example: Custom Schema for Numeric String Fields

If you have string fields that contain numeric values that you want to filter numerically:

```python
# Define custom schema that treats a string field as numeric
index_schema = {
    "properties": [
        {
            "name": "credit_score",
            "type": "NUMERIC"  # Even though credit_score might be stored as a string
        }
    ]
}

# Create vector store with this schema
vector_store = InMemoryVectorStore(
    redis_url=redis_url,
    index_name="credit_data_index",
    embedding=embedding_model,
    index_schema=index_schema
)

# Add documents with credit scores
texts = ["Customer profile information"]
metadatas = [{"credit_score": "720"}]  # String, but will be indexed as numeric

vector_store.add_texts(texts=texts, metadatas=metadatas)
```

## Performing Similarity Searches with Filtering

Now that we've set up our vector store with custom schemas, we can perform advanced similarity searches with filtering:

```python
# Basic similarity search
results = vector_store.similarity_search(
    query="Redis compatible database",
    k=5  # Return top 5 results
)

# Similarity search with metadata filtering
from langchain_aws.vectorstores.inmemorydb import InMemoryDBFilterExpression

# Filter for documents from 2023 about databases
filter_expr = (
    InMemoryDBFilterExpression.field("category").equals("database") &
    InMemoryDBFilterExpression.field("year").equals(2023)
)

filtered_results = vector_store.similarity_search(
    query="Redis compatible database",
    k=5,
    filter=filter_expr
)

# Similarity search with distance threshold
threshold_results = vector_store.similarity_search(
    query="Redis compatible database",
    k=10,
    distance_threshold=0.2  # Only return results with distance less than 0.2
)
```

## Advanced Search Techniques

`InMemoryVectorStore` supports various advanced search techniques:

### Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) Search

MMR search balances relevance to the query with diversity among results:

```python
mmr_results = vector_store.max_marginal_relevance_search(
    query="database technologies",
    k=5,                # Number of results to return
    fetch_k=20,         # Number of results to consider before reranking
    lambda_mult=0.5     # Balance between relevance (1.0) and diversity (0.0)
)
```

### Similarity Search with Relevance Scores

To get both documents and their relevance scores:

```python
scored_results = vector_store.similarity_search_with_relevance_scores(
    query="vector database technology"
)

for doc, score in scored_results:
    print(f"Document: {doc.page_content[:50]}... | Relevance: {score}")
```

## Managing the Vector Store

### Adding More Documents

You can add more documents to an existing vector store:

```python
new_docs = text_splitter.split_documents(new_documents)
vector_store.add_documents(new_docs)

# Or add texts directly
new_texts = ["New information about AWS MemoryDB"]
new_metadatas = [{"source": "recent_update", "category": "database", "year": 2023}]
vector_store.add_texts(texts=new_texts, metadatas=new_metadatas)
```

### Deleting Documents

```python
# Delete specific documents by their IDs
vector_store.delete(ids=["doc_id_1", "doc_id_2"])

# Delete all documents (use with caution)
vector_store.delete()
```

### Dropping an Index

To completely remove an index:

```python
InMemoryVectorStore.drop_index(
    index_name="my_production_index",
    delete_documents=True,
    redis_url=redis_url
)
```

## Using the Vector Store as a Retriever

You can easily convert your vector store into a LangChain retriever for use in chains and agents:

```python
retriever = vector_store.as_retriever(
    search_type="mmr",  # Can be "similarity", "mmr", or "similarity_score_threshold"
    search_kwargs={
        "k": 5,
        "lambda_mult": 0.7,
        "filter": filter_expr
    }
)

# Use the retriever in a chain
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name="gpt-4")
qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
    llm=llm,
    chain_type="stuff",
    retriever=retriever
)

result = qa_chain.invoke({"query": "What are the advantages of AWS MemoryDB?"})
print(result["result"])
```

## Exporting and Managing Schemas

For documentation and version control, you can write the schema to a file:

```python
vector_store.write_schema("path/to/schema.yaml")
```

## Asynchronous Operations

`InMemoryVectorStore` also supports asynchronous operations, which can be beneficial for high-throughput applications:

```python
import asyncio

async def async_search_example():
    results = await vector_store.asimilarity_search(
        query="Redis compatible database",
        k=5
    )
    return results

results = asyncio.run(async_search_example())
```

## Best Practices for Production RAG Systems

1. **Choose the right algorithm**: Use HNSW instead of FLAT for large datasets to balance search speed and accuracy.

2. **Optimize metadata schema**: Define proper field types (TAG, TEXT, NUMERIC) based on how you'll query the data.

3. **Use TAG fields for exact matching**: For fields where you need exact matches (like categories or IDs), use TAG type.

4. **Set appropriate distance thresholds**: Use distance_threshold to filter out low-quality matches.

5. **Implement proper error handling**: In production, wrap vector store operations in try-except blocks.

6. **Monitor performance**: Keep track of query latency and result quality.

7. **Implement connection pooling**: For high-throughput applications, use connection pooling to manage Redis connections.

8. **Regularly backup your data**: Even though MemoryDB is durable, implement regular backups.
