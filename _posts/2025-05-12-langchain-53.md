# Advanced LLM Application Development: Leveraging ChatWrapper in LangChain for Streaming, Tool Binding, and Fallback Strategies

In the evolving landscape of large language model (LLM) applications, developers constantly seek ways to enhance functionality, reliability, and user experience. LangChain's `ChatWrapper` offers a powerful solution for implementing advanced features in LLM applications. This article explores how to leverage `ChatWrapper` for streaming responses, binding tools, and implementing fallback strategies to create robust LLM applications.

## Understanding ChatWrapper in LangChain

`ChatWrapper` is a versatile class in LangChain that wraps chat language models, providing a standardized interface with enhanced functionality. As an implementation of the `BaseChatModel`, it includes the standard Runnable Interface, giving developers access to methods like `with_config`, `with_types`, `with_retry`, and more.

```python
from langchain_experimental.chat_models import ChatWrapper
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# Create a base chat model
base_model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo")

# Wrap it with ChatWrapper for enhanced functionality
wrapped_model = ChatWrapper(llm=base_model)
```

## Streaming Responses for Real-Time Interaction

One of the key features of `ChatWrapper` is its support for streaming responses, which allows applications to display model outputs to users in real-time instead of waiting for the complete response.

### Basic Streaming Implementation

```python
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage

# Create messages
messages = [HumanMessage(content="Write a short poem about artificial intelligence")]

# Stream the response
for chunk in wrapped_model.stream(messages):
    print(chunk.content, end="", flush=True)
```

### Controlling Streaming Behavior

`ChatWrapper` provides flexibility in controlling streaming behavior through the `bypass_streaming` parameter:

```python
# Always use streaming when available
normal_streaming = ChatWrapper(llm=base_model, bypass_streaming=False)

# Always bypass streaming
no_streaming = ChatWrapper(llm=base_model, bypass_streaming=True)

# Bypass streaming only when tools are used
conditional_streaming = ChatWrapper(llm=base_model, bypass_streaming="tool_calling")
```

## Binding Tools for Enhanced Capabilities

Tool binding is another powerful feature that allows LLM applications to extend their capabilities by connecting the model to external functions or APIs.

### Implementing Tool Binding

```python
from langchain_core.tools import tool

@tool
def get_weather(location: str) -> str:
    """Get the current weather in a given location."""
    # In a real application, this would call a weather API
    return f"It's sunny and 72Â°F in {location}."

@tool
def calculate_mortgage(principal: float, rate: float, years: int) -> str:
    """Calculate monthly mortgage payment."""
    monthly_rate = rate / 100 / 12
    months = years * 12
    payment = principal * (monthly_rate * (1 + monthly_rate)**months) / ((1 + monthly_rate)**months - 1)
    return f"Monthly payment: ${payment:.2f}"

# Bind tools to the wrapped model
tools = [get_weather, calculate_mortgage]
model_with_tools = wrapped_model.bind_tools(tools=tools)

# Use the model with tools
response = model_with_tools.invoke("What's the weather in New York?")
print(response.content)
```

### Controlling Tool Selection

You can control which tools the model uses with the `tool_choice` parameter:

```python
# Allow the model to choose any tool
model_any_tool = wrapped_model.bind_tools(tools=tools, tool_choice="any")

# Force the model to use a specific tool
model_weather_tool = wrapped_model.bind_tools(tools=tools, tool_choice="get_weather")
```

## Implementing Fallback Strategies for Reliability

Fallback strategies are crucial for building reliable LLM applications that can handle errors gracefully. `ChatWrapper` makes this easy with the `with_fallbacks` method.

### Basic Fallback Implementation

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# Create primary and fallback models
primary_model = ChatWrapper(llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4"))
fallback_model = ChatWrapper(llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo"))

# Create a model with fallback
robust_model = primary_model.with_fallbacks(
    fallbacks=[fallback_model],
    exceptions_to_handle=(Exception,)
)

# Use the robust model
try:
    response = robust_model.invoke("Explain quantum computing")
    print(response.content)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Both models failed: {e}")
```

### Advanced Fallback with Exception Handling

You can also pass exceptions to fallbacks to help them understand what went wrong:

```python
# Create a model with fallback that passes exceptions
robust_model_with_context = primary_model.with_fallbacks(
    fallbacks=[fallback_model],
    exceptions_to_handle=(Exception,),
    exception_key="error"  # Pass the exception to the fallback
)

# The fallback model can now access the error information
```

## Combining Features for Comprehensive Applications

The real power of `ChatWrapper` comes from combining multiple features to create comprehensive LLM applications.

### Example: Robust Tool-Enabled Streaming Application

```python
from langchain_core.messages import SystemMessage
from langchain_core.callbacks import StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler

# Create a robust, tool-enabled model with streaming
robust_tool_model = ChatWrapper(
    llm=ChatOpenAI(
        model="gpt-4",
        streaming=True,
        callbacks=[StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler()]
    )
).bind_tools(
    tools=[get_weather, calculate_mortgage]
).with_fallbacks(
    fallbacks=[
        ChatWrapper(
            llm=ChatOpenAI(
                model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
                streaming=True,
                callbacks=[StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler()]
            )
        ).bind_tools(tools=[get_weather, calculate_mortgage])
    ]
)

# Create a conversational agent
messages = [
    SystemMessage(content="You are a helpful assistant with access to tools."),
    HumanMessage(content="I'm buying a $300,000 house with a 30-year mortgage at 4.5% interest. What will my payment be?")
]

# Get streaming response with tool use and fallback capabilities
response = robust_tool_model.invoke(messages)
```

## Implementing Schema Validation for Structured Outputs

For applications requiring structured data, `ChatWrapper` supports schema validation using the `with_structured_output` method:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class MortgageCalculation(BaseModel):
    monthly_payment: float = Field(description="Monthly mortgage payment in dollars")
    total_interest: float = Field(description="Total interest paid over the life of the loan")
    total_cost: float = Field(description="Total cost of the loan including principal and interest")

# Create a model that returns structured output
structured_model = wrapped_model.with_structured_output(schema=MortgageCalculation)

# Get structured data
result = structured_model.invoke("Calculate mortgage for $250,000 at 4.5% for 30 years")
print(f"Monthly payment: ${result.monthly_payment:.2f}")
print(f"Total interest: ${result.total_interest:.2f}")
print(f"Total cost: ${result.total_cost:.2f}")
```

## Performance Optimization with Caching

`ChatWrapper` supports caching to improve performance for repeated queries:

```python
from langchain.globals import set_llm_cache
from langchain.cache import InMemoryCache

# Set up global cache
set_llm_cache(InMemoryCache())

# Create a cached model
cached_model = ChatWrapper(llm=base_model, cache=True)

# First call will be slow
response1 = cached_model.invoke("What is the capital of France?")

# Second call with the same input will be instant
response2 = cached_model.invoke("What is the capital of France?")
```

## Conclusion
