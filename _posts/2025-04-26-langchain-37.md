# Implementing SambaNova LLMs in LangChain Applications: A Comprehensive Guide to ChatSambaStudio Integration

SambaNova Systems has emerged as a significant player in the enterprise AI space, offering powerful large language models that can be integrated into various applications. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore how to leverage SambaNova's LLMs within the LangChain framework, focusing specifically on the `ChatSambaStudio` integration.

## Introduction to SambaNova and LangChain

SambaNova provides enterprise-grade AI models through its SambaStudio platform. These models can be accessed via API endpoints and integrated into applications built with LangChain, a popular framework for developing applications powered by language models.

The `ChatSambaStudio` class in LangChain provides a streamlined interface for interacting with SambaNova's models, allowing developers to easily incorporate these powerful LLMs into their applications.

## Getting Started with ChatSambaStudio

### Prerequisites

Before you can use SambaNova's models with LangChain, you'll need:

1. A SambaStudio account with API access
2. The endpoint URL for your deployed model
3. An API key for authentication

### Setting Up Environment Variables

The recommended way to configure your SambaNova credentials is through environment variables:

```python
import os

os.environ["SAMBASTUDIO_URL"] = "your-sambastudio-endpoint-url"
os.environ["SAMBASTUDIO_API_KEY"] = "your-sambastudio-api-key"
```

Alternatively, you can provide these credentials directly when initializing the `ChatSambaStudio` class.

## Basic Implementation

Here's a simple example of how to initialize and use the `ChatSambaStudio` class:

```python
from langchain_community.chat_models import ChatSambaStudio
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage, SystemMessage

# Initialize the chat model
chat = ChatSambaStudio(
    model_name="Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct-4096",  # Specify the model to use
    temperature=0.7,                              # Control randomness
    max_tokens=1024                               # Limit response length
)

# Create messages
messages = [
    SystemMessage(content="You are a helpful AI assistant."),
    HumanMessage(content="Explain quantum computing in simple terms.")
]

# Generate a response
response = chat.invoke(messages)
print(response.content)
```

## Advanced Configuration

The `ChatSambaStudio` class offers numerous parameters to customize the behavior of the model:

### Model Selection and Generation Parameters

```python
chat = ChatSambaStudio(
    model_name="Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct-4096",  # Model name
    temperature=0.7,                              # Controls randomness (0-1)
    max_tokens=1024,                              # Maximum tokens to generate
    top_p=0.95,                                   # Nucleus sampling parameter
    top_k=40,                                     # Top-k sampling parameter
    do_sample=True                                # Whether to use sampling
)
```

### Streaming Responses

You can enable streaming to receive responses token by token:

```python
chat = ChatSambaStudio(
    model_name="Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct-4096",
    streaming=True
)

for chunk in chat.stream([HumanMessage(content="Write a short poem about AI.")]):
    print(chunk.content, end="", flush=True)
```

### Prompt Processing Options

For Bundle generic endpoints (v1 and v2), you can control prompt processing:

```python
chat = ChatSambaStudio(
    model_name="Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct-4096",
    process_prompt=False,  # Disable automatic prompt processing
    # Define special tokens for manual prompt formatting
    special_tokens={
        "start": "<s>",
        "start_role": "[INST]",
        "end_role": "[/INST]",
        "end": "</s>"
    }
)
```

## Working with Structured Output

One of the powerful features of LangChain is the ability to get structured outputs from LLMs. You can use the `with_structured_output` method to format responses according to a specific schema:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import List

class MovieRecommendation(BaseModel):
    title: str = Field(description="The title of the movie")
    year: int = Field(description="The year the movie was released")
    genre: str = Field(description="The primary genre of the movie")
    reasons: List[str] = Field(description="Reasons why this movie is recommended")

# Create a structured output parser
structured_chat = chat.with_structured_output(MovieRecommendation)

# Get structured recommendations
response = structured_chat.invoke("Recommend a sci-fi movie from the 1980s")

# Access the structured data
print(f"Title: {response.title}")
print(f"Year: {response.year}")
print(f"Genre: {response.genre}")
print("Reasons:")
for reason in response.reasons:
    print(f"- {reason}")
```

## Error Handling and Retries

When working with external API services like SambaNova, it's important to implement proper error handling. LangChain provides built-in retry functionality:

```python
from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser

# Create a chat model with retry capabilities
robust_chat = chat.with_retry(
    stop_after_attempt=3,  # Maximum number of retry attempts
    wait_exponential_jitter=True  # Use exponential backoff with jitter
)

# Create a simple chain with error handling
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate

prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
    ("system", "You are a helpful assistant."),
    ("human", "{input}")
])

chain = prompt | robust_chat | StrOutputParser()

try:
    result = chain.invoke({"input": "What is the capital of France?"})
    print(result)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error after retries: {e}")
```

## Caching Responses

To improve performance and reduce API costs, you can enable caching for your SambaNova model calls:

```python
from langchain.globals import set_llm_cache
from langchain.cache import InMemoryCache

# Set up a global cache
set_llm_cache(InMemoryCache())

# Create a chat model with caching enabled
cached_chat = ChatSambaStudio(
    model_name="Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct-4096",
    cache=True  # Enable caching
)

# First call will hit the API
response1 = cached_chat.invoke([HumanMessage(content="What is 2+2?")])

# Second identical call will use the cached response
response2 = cached_chat.invoke([HumanMessage(content="What is 2+2?")])
```

## Rate Limiting

For production applications, it's important to implement rate limiting to avoid overwhelming the API:

```python
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig
from langchain_core.runnables.utils import RateLimiter

# Create a rate limiter (e.g., 10 requests per minute)
rate_limiter = RateLimiter(max_calls_per_minute=10)

# Configure the chat model with the rate limiter
chat = ChatSambaStudio(
    model_name="Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct-4096",
    rate_limiter=rate_limiter
)
```

## Building Complex Applications

Let's put everything together to build a more complex application that leverages SambaNova's LLMs within a LangChain application:

```python
from langchain_community.chat_models import ChatSambaStudio
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser
from langchain_community.retrievers import WikipediaRetriever
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnablePassthrough
import os

# Set up environment variables
os.environ["SAMBASTUDIO_URL"] = "your-sambastudio-endpoint-url"
os.environ["SAMBASTUDIO_API_KEY"] = "your-sambastudio-api-key"

# Initialize the chat model
chat = ChatSambaStudio(
    model_name="Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct-4096",
    temperature=0.7,
    max_tokens=1024,
    streaming=True
)

# Create a retriever
retriever = WikipediaRetriever(top_k_results=3)

# Create a template for RAG
template = """
You are a helpful assistant that answers questions based on the provided context.

Context:
{context}

Question: {question}

Provide a comprehensive answer based on the context provided. If the context doesn't contain 
relevant information, say so and provide general information on the topic.
"""

prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(template)

# Create a RAG chain
def format_docs(docs):
    return "\n\n".join(doc.page_content for doc in docs)

rag_chain = (
    {"context": retriever | format_docs, "question": RunnablePassthrough()}
    | prompt
    | chat
    | StrOutputParser()
)

# Use the chain
question = "What are the main principles of quantum computing?"
for chunk in rag_chain.stream(question):
    print(chunk, end="", flush=True)
```

## Best Practices for Using SambaNova with LangChain

1. **Model Selection**: Choose the appropriate SambaNova model based on your application's requirements. Models like Llama 3 70B offer high capability but may have higher latency and cost compared to smaller models.

2. **Parameter Tuning**: Experiment with different temperature, top_p, and top_k values to find the optimal settings for your use case.

3. **Prompt Engineering**: Craft clear, specific prompts to get the best results from SambaNova's models.

4. **Token Management**: Be mindful of token limits in both your prompts and generated responses to avoid truncation.

5. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling and retry mechanisms for production applications.

6. **Caching**: Use caching for repetitive queries to improve performance and reduce costs.

7. **Security**: Store API keys securely and never expose them in client-side code.

## Migrating from Deprecated Versions

Note that `ChatSambaStudio` from `langchain_community.chat_models.sambanova` has been deprecated since version 0.3.16. For new implementations, you should use `langchain_sambanova.ChatSambaStudio` instead. The migration is straightforward:

```python
# Deprecated
from langchain_community.chat_models.sambanova import ChatSambaStudio

# New recommended import
from langchain_sambanova import ChatSambaStudio
```

The interface and functionality remain largely the same, so your existing code should require minimal changes.

## Conclusion

Integrating SambaNova's powerful LLMs with LangChain provides a robust foundation for building sophisticated AI applications. The `ChatSambaStudio` class offers a flexible interface with numerous configuration options to tailor the behavior of the models to your specific needs.

By following the implementation patterns and best practices outlined in this guide, you can effectively leverage SambaNova's enterprise-grade AI models within your LangChain applications, enabling a wide range of use cases from conversational agents to document analysis and beyond.

Whether you're building a simple chatbot or a complex RAG system, the combination of SambaNova's high-performance models and LangChain's flexible framework creates a powerful toolkit for modern AI application development.
